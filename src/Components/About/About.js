                <h1>About me :</h1>

                <p> My name is Javier Marin and I am a junior full stack developer and currently
                    a senior at the University of Houston where I am majoring in Computer Information
                    Systems. I am also a graduate in the Software engineering program at Flatiron school.
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    Programming is a bittersweet art form for me. One minute I could be loving it and then the next I could be
                    wanting to tear my hair out trying to debug an error, but thats what I enjoy about it, the challenge and the gratification
                    I get from it. Programming is a job/hobby that is always changing.Its something where you have to be ok with always learning and adapating,and thats a journey im willing to take.
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    When im not typing away at my keyboard you can find me hanging out with family,watching a movie, working out, or reading.
