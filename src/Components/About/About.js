                <h1>About me. </h1>

                <p> My name is Javier Marin and I am a junior full stack developer and currently
                    a senior at the University of Houston where I am majoring in Computer Information
                    Systems. I am also a graduate in the Software engineering program at Flatiron.
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    Programming is a bittersweet art form for me. One minute I could be loving it and then the next I could be
                    wanting to tear my hair out trying to debug an error, but thats what I really enjoy about it, the challenge and the gratification
                    I get from it. Programming is a job/hobby that is always constantly changing.Its something where you have to be ok with always learning and adapating.

                    When im not typing away at my keyboard you can find me hanging out with my family,watching a movie, working out, or reading a book.
                    I am always looking for projects that can help me grow and learn new technologies. Feel free to send me a message if you are interested
                    in collaborating with me or just want to talk.
