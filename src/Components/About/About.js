                <h1>About me :</h1>

                <p> My name is Javier Marin and i am a junior full stack developer. I am currently
                    a senior at the University of Houston where i am majoring in Computer Information
                    Systems. I am also a graduate in the Software engineering program at Flatiron school.
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    Programming is a bittersweet art form for me. One minute i could be loving it and then the next i could be
                    wanting to tear my hair out trying to debug an error, but thats what i enjoy about it, the challenge and the gratification
                    i get from it. Programming is a job/hobby that is always changing and you have to be ok with never really
                    knowing everything about it.Its something where you have to be ok with always learning and adapating,and thats a journey im willing to take.
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    When im not typing away at my keyboard you can find me hanging out with family,watching a movie, working out, or reading.
